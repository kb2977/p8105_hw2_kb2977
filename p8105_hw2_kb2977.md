Problem 1
---------

Using pipline to:

-   Import NYC Transit data using relative paths into a subdirectory
-   Read and clean the data
-   Retain line, station, name, station latitude / longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance.
-   Convert the entry variable from character (YES vs NO) to a logical variable (the ifelse or recode function may be useful).

``` r
transit_data = 
  read_csv(file = "./data/nyc_transit_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line, starts_with("station"), starts_with("route"), entrance_type, entry, vending, ada, 
         -station_location) %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route9 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route10 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route11 = col_integer(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

Explanation of dataset:

Write a short paragraph about this dataset â€“ explain briefly what variables the dataset contains, describe your data cleaning steps so far, and give the dimension (rows x columns) of the resulting dataset. Are these data tidy?

``` r
transit_data_distinct = distinct(transit_data, station_name, line, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

Short numeric summary of dataset:

There are 465 distinct stations. There are 84 stations that are ADA compliant. There are 0.0108 proportion of station entrances/exits without vending that allow entrance.

Below is the reformated data so that route number and route name are distinct variables.

``` r
transit_data_tidy = transit_data_distinct %>% 
  gather(key = route_number, value = route_name, route1:route11)
```

There are 60 distinct stations that serve the A train. Of the 60 distinct stations that serve the A train, 17 are ADA compliant. How many distinct stations serve the A train? Of the stations that serve the A train, how many are ADA compliant?
