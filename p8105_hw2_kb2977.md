Problem 1
---------

Using pipline to:

-   Import NYC Transit data using relative paths into a subdirectory
-   Read and clean the data
-   Retain line, station, name, station latitude / longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance.
-   Convert the entry variable from character (YES vs NO) to a logical variable (the ifelse or recode function may be useful).

``` r
transit_data = 
  read_csv(file = "./data/nyc_transit_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line, starts_with("station"), starts_with("route"), entrance_type, entry, vending, ada, 
         -station_location) %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route9 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route10 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route11 = col_integer(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

Explanation of dataset:

The variables line, station name, station latitude/longitude, route number, entrance type, entry, vending, and ada were include in the dataset "transit\_data". First, I read in the csv file of the NYC transit data then cleaned the names by using janitor::clean\_names and changed the variable names to lowerclass and put in "\_" for spaces. I also recoded the variable "entry" to a logical variable (i.e. TRUE and FALSE). The resulting data has 1868 rows and 19 columns. This data isn't tidy because we see that route number is spread across 11 columns.

Below I kept only the distinct stations by station name and line:

``` r
transit_data_distinct = distinct(transit_data, station_name, line, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

Short numeric summary of dataset based on distinct stations:

-   There are 465 distinct stations.
-   There are 84 stations that are ADA compliant.
-   0.0108 of station entrances and exits without vending are allowed entrance.

Below is the reformated data so that route number and route name are distinct variables.

``` r
transit_data_tidy = transit_data_distinct %>% 
  gather(key = route_number, value = route_name, route1:route11)
```

-   There are 60 distinct stations that serve the A train.
-   Of the 60 distinct stations that serve the A train, 17 are ADA compliant.
